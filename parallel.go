// Package parallel is an implementation of structured concurrency for go.
// https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/
//
// It is designed to help reason about parallel code by ensuring that
// go-routines are started and stopped in a strictly nested pattern: a child
// goroutine will never outlive its parent.
package parallel

	// OnPanic is called when a goroutine panics. You should return
	// false from this if you don't wish the panic to propagate.

// Do starts a new parallel execution context and runs it to completion.
//
// After f has run, and after any goroutines started by p.Go have finished,
// Do will mark p as finished and then return. Any further calls to p.Go will panic.
//
// In practice this means that you can only safely call p.Go from within f,
// or within the goroutines started by p.Go.
//
// If f, or any goroutine started by p.Go panics, then Do will panic.
//
// The panic behaviour can be overwritten by setting p.OnPanic
// from within the callback passed to .Do() before any calls to .Go().
